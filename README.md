In this project, the objective is to build a NBA MVP prediction model and forecast the upcoming MVP for the current (2022) season. 

To run the notebook files using the required dependencies, simply create a new environment using the yml file with conda
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
then switch to the **nba_mvp_project** kernel
